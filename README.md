# convex-optimization

This repo is massively influenced by [Ryan Tibshirani couse at CMU](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/convexopt-F18/). The solutions though are completely mine, unless I mention otherwise.

I will also some results from the course that I'm undertaken at my univeristy (PASSAU). 

So far it contains the follwing:

### Tutorial 1: Convexity, Convex functions, $L-\nabla f$, and many more cool tricks

### Tutorial 2: Convergence rates of SGD

### Tutorial 3: I wonder!
